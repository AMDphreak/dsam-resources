Open `http://localhost:8000`.

== Build

With your virtual environment activated:

[source]
----
mkdocs build
----

Artifacts are written to the `site/` directory.

== Why requirements.txt?

- MkDocs and its plugins are Python packages. Pinning versions ensures consistent local and CI builds.
- Locally, install into a virtual environment (as shown). No global Python installs are required.

== Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers the GitHub Pages workflow to build and deploy the site.
