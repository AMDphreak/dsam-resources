**SSDI** = Social Security Disability Insurance
**SSI** = Supplemental Security Income

| Program | Benefit | Program Type |
|---|---|---|
| SSDI | Medicare | Federal |
| SSI | Medicaid | State |

SSDI grants *Medicare*, while SSI grants *Medicaid*. Medicare and Medicaid are similar but different programs intended to provide medical insurance for those with disabilities or other qualifying conditions. You can qualify for one or both of these, but, depending on how much the Federal government gives you for SSDI, you may not qualify for SSI.

| Program | Description |
|---|---|
| SSDI | If you apply for *Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)* through the **Federal** government, and are approved, you'll receive Medicare.<br>If you're getting SSDI, eventually, you'll be eligible for Medicare benefits--but not until two years after your "date of entitlement". This is the date Social Security says you're eligible to start collecting benefits. Your date of entitlement could be as much as a year before you applied for SSDI, cutting your wait time to 1 year. |
| SSI | If you apply for *Supplemental Security Income* through the **State** government, and are approved, you'll receive Medicaid.<br>In most US states, Medicaid eligibility is automatic for SSI recipients, so you'll get Medicaid as soon as you're approved for SSI. Tennessee and Mississippi both are automatic.<br>Exclusions: If you're already receiving enough help from the Federal government, the State does not want to give you money. Receiving SSDI benefits or retirement income can prevent you from qualifying for Medicaid, since they count as income for purposes of Medicaid eligibility. |
